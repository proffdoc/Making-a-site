    <strong><h1>What is HyperText</h1></strong>
    <p>Hypertext is text which is not constrained to be linear.</p>
    <p>Hypertext is text which contains <a href="index5,2.html">links</a>to other texts. The term was coined by <a href="index5,3.html">Ted Nelson</a>around 1965 (see <a href="index5,4.html">History</a>).</p>
<p>HyperMedia is a term used for hypertext which is not constrained to be text: it can include graphics, video and <a href="index5,5.html">sound</a> , for example. Apparently Ted Nelson was the first to use this term too.</p>
<p>Hypertext and HyperMedia are concepts, not products.</p>
